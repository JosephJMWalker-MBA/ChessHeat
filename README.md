# ChessHeat

This Next.js application, created with Firebase Studio, provides a heatmap visualization of square control on a chessboard.

Enter a FEN string to see which side, White or Black, has more influence over each square. The app also uses AI to generate insights on key tactical areas.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the development server:
